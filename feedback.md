### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)? __1 Meets expectations__

  * A **hosted copy of your game or app, built by you**, hosted on Github Pages

    :+1:

  * Your HTML/CSS should pass the [HTML5 Validator](https://html5.validator.nu) and [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

    :+1: :+1:

  * A **git repository hosted on Github** with frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project

    :+1:

  * A **link to your hosted project** in the URL section of your Github repo

    :+1:

  * **A ``readme.md`` file**, including
    * Explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

      :+1: Awesome readme. Only thing I would add is maybe checkout [markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and you can style your .md files.

    * At least 5 [user stories](https://github.com/ga-dc/curriculum/tree/master/02-intermediate-front-end/process-stories-wireframes).

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex? __2 Exceeds expectations__

  Your app must:

  * **Render in the browser** :+1:
  * **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files** :+1:
  * Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles:+1:
  * Use **Javascript or jQuery** for **DOM manipulation** :+1:
  * **Deploy online**, using [Github **Project** pages](https://pages.github.com). :+1:
  * Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices) :+1:

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class? __2 Exceeds expectations__

  Really great job here. I left comments in the code that start with jsm:. As far as your question about the necessity of using the 20 classes, nothing jumps out at me as a dramatically better way of setting appropriate backgrounds. You could keep a javascript object which relates card numbers to background image sources which would let you right slightly more generic css and use jquery to set backgrounds.

* __Problem Solving__: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations? __2 Exceeds expectations__

  Code comments are excellent. You also did a great job of creating challenges for yourself and then tackling them.

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between: __2 Exceeds expectations__

Score | Expectations
----- | ------------
**0** | _Does not meet expectations._
**1** | _Meets expectactions, good job!_
**2** | _Exceeds expectations_



This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
